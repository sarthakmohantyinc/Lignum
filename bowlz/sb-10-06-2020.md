Depends on **pressure** and **volume**

## Doppler Effect

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

an increase \(or decrease\) in the frequency of sound, light, or other waves as the source and observer move toward \(or away from\) each other. The effect causes the sudden change in pitch noticeable in a passing siren, as well as the redshift seen by astronomers.

## Grand Unified Theory

 A Grand Unified **Theory** \(GUT\) is a model in particle physics in which, at high energies, the three gauge interactions of the Standard Model comprising the electromagnetic, weak, and strong **forces** are merged into a single **force**.

## String Theory

 In physics, **string theory** is a **theoretical** framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called **strings**. **String theory** describes how these **strings** propagate through space and interact with each other.

## Isobars

* shows **pressure**

## ATP

* stores **chemical energy** in bonds
