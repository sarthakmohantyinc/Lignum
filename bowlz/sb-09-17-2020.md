## Lewis Theory

## Thorium Oxide

## Human Biceps Femoris

## Diencephalon

* Right Thalamus - relay center for neuron impulses
* Left Thalamus - relay center for neuron impulses
* Cerebellum - balance and other voluntary things
* Hypothalamus - control release of hormones

## Earthquakes

* The effect of an earthquake on the Earth's surface is called the **intensity**. ... The **Modified Mercalli Intensity** value assigned to a specific site after an earthquake has a more meaningful **measure** of severity to the nonscientist than the magnitude because **intensity** refers to the effects actually experienced at that place.
