### **Ch 11:  Section 3: The Decline of the Church**

* What is the papacy \(PAY-peh-see\)?  When did it reach its highest power?  What events caused it to lose some of its reputation in the late middle ages?
* What is a papal bull?  Who issues them?  What did the Unam Sanctam state?
* Why did the residence of the Pope and many cardinals change from Rome to Avignon?
* It is generally said the prestige of the papacy declined while at Avignon.  Why was this the case?
* During the Great Schism, two men called themselves the rightful Pope.  Who were they, and which kingdoms supported each?
* Marsiglio de Padua wrote Defender of the Peace where he said the church was only one element of society and should confine itself to spiritual functions and that the clergy held no special authority.  Gradually more and more people adopted his theory, known as what?
* Because of all of the chaos in the 14th century, Spielvogel argues Christians became increasingly preoccupied with death.  A few notions to his argument are significant:
  * People increased performance of "good works" - what are these and why did people do them?
  * The concept of "purgatory" became increasingly important - what is it?
  * People increasingly completed good works without clerics or clergymen - why is that significant?
  * The expansion of "mysticism" - what is it, and what kinds of behaviors can be considered mystical?

### **Ch 12: Section 7: The Church in the Renaissance**

* After the Great Schism ended, what new problem was the Roman Catholic Church having difficulty controlling?  What two movements can be considered the most prominent threats to the church?
* What is a "Lollard" and who did they follow?  What were two fundamental beliefs of their leader?
* Who is John Hus?  What were his beliefs?  Who were his followers?
* What was the Council of Constance?  Explain the two decrees of the Council of Constance.  How effective \(or ineffective\) were these decrees?
* Who was the Warrior Pope?  Why was he called this?
* Explain how nepotism affected the papacy.

### Ch 13: Prelude to Reformation:

* What were the major differences of the Northern Renaissance from the Italian Renaissance?
* How was the Northern Renaissance, in some ways, similar to the Italian renaissance?
* Compare and contrast Erasmus with Thomas More using the chart below

|  | **Desiderius Erasmus** | **Thomas More** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Location** |  |  |
| **Years Active** |  |  |
| **Famous Works** |  |  |
| **Core Beliefs** |  |  |

* Who held the highest positions among the clergy?  What is the bourgeoisie?
* How did the church increase its revenues?   What is pluralism?
* Spielvogel has often said that changes in Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries led the salvation process to become more mechanical.  What does he mean by this?   Why did it happen?  What are indulgences and how do they fit into this process?
* What are "laymen" or "laypeople"?  How do they differ from the clergy?  What are examples of some Catholic orders who called for reform of the corrupt clergy?
