# Getting an Authentication Key

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a superhero is a fairly straightforward process:

```
$ openssl rand -base64 24 |md5 |head -c24;echo
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please regenerate if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once that's generated, let me know the API key so I can authenticate it with my server.
